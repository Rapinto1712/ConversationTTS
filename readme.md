# ConversationTTS: A Speech Foundation Model for Multilingual Conversational Text-to-Speech

![ConversationTTS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Release-Download%20Latest%20Version-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)

## Introduction

Welcome to the ConversationTTS repository. This project provides the training and inference code for a state-of-the-art speech synthesis model. Our model is designed for multilingual conversational text-to-speech applications. 

We are excited to share the first checkpoint, which has been trained on 1.5 epochs using approximately 200,000 hours of speech data. This foundational model can serve various applications, from voice assistants to educational tools.

### Checkpoint V1: 1B-20w-1.5epoch

To get started, you can download the initial checkpoint using the following command:

```bash
wget https://huggingface.co/AudioFoundation/SpeechFoundation/resolve/main/ckpt1.checkpoint
```

This checkpoint provides a solid base for further experimentation and development.

### Data

The training process utilized a diverse set of large-scale TTS datasets, including:

- **Emili-Yodas**
- **WenetSpeech**
- **MLS**
- **People Speech**

In addition to these datasets, we collected a variety of podcast datasets in multiple languages, including English, Chinese, and Cantonese. We label different speakers in the datasets using identifiers like [1], [2], and so on. 

Currently, the model is trained on 200,000 hours of data. Future updates will include checkpoints trained on over 500,000 hours of data, enhancing the model's capabilities and performance.
